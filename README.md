This is a basic student performance analysis with predefined data using basics of machine learning. We used a predetermined dataset consisting of students marksheets. The output analysis is visualized using graphs for each subject and its chapters. It is done using K-Clustering algorithom which is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Here a subject mark's labels are grouped into one single cluster.

<p>As you can see it in the above examples, Various students Maths marks are represented graphically according to their performance. It shows various students are in the Safe zone and a few are in the danger zone, that is, they obtained few marks. We can also see students who performed well and those who are above average. By this labels we can predict the marks of uncoming exams for each student.<p>
